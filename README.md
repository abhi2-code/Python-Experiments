# Python-Experiments

Welcome to the **Python-Experiments** repository!  
This project is a personal collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python applications created for learning, exploring, and experimenting with Python’s vast capabilities.  
Each file in this repository represents a small but focused project that demonstrates the use of specific concepts such as computer vision, GUI development, game logic, and file handling.

## 🎮 Project: `gesturedino.py`

> **Goal:** Control a Chrome Dinosaur game using your hand gestures!

- Built using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyAutoGUI**.
- Detects your hand movements via webcam.
- Jump by raising your hand; duck by lowering it.
- A fun experiment integrating gesture recognition with game automation.

---

## 🖼️ Project: `pencil_sketch.py`

> **Goal:** Transform any image into a pencil sketch.

- Takes an image as input and applies filters to make it look hand-drawn.
- Uses **grayscale conversion**, **Gaussian blur**, and **image division** techniques.
- Great demonstration of OpenCV’s basic operations.

---

## 🐍 Project: `snakegame.py`

> **Goal:** Play the classic Snake Game in Python!

- Built using the **Pygame** library.
- Arrow keys to control the snake.
- Game ends when snake hits the wall or itself.
- Features score tracking and grid-based design.

---

## ✅ Project: `todo_list.py`

> **Goal:** Simple and minimalistic GUI-based To-Do list.

- Built using **Tkinter** for the interface.
- Add, remove, and manage tasks.
- Tasks stored temporarily (can be extended to file-based or DB storage).
- Great for learning how GUIs and listbox interactions work.
